# Commonly Used Algorithms
Consists of (mostly) C programs that are implementations of common algorithms with command-line utility wrappers.

To make use of the compiled utilities, make sure that you add the `util` folder generated by the Makefile to PATH.

## Generating the utilities
1. Clone this project to some location
2. Navigate into this cloned folder in the shell.
3. Run `make`. It will compile and build all the binaries. The tests and other executables will be in `./bin/`. The utilities will be in `./util/`
